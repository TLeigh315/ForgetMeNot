In order to get consistent texts without text messages:
	Terminated each message variable with \r NOT \r\n
	Disabled serial login (Probably ended the distortion issue also)
		sudo systemctl stop serial-getty@ttyAMA0.service //disables login for current session TEMPORARY
		sudo systemctl disable serial-getty@ttyAMA0.service //disables serial at boot TEMPORARY
		sudo systemctl mask serial-getty@ttyAMA0.service //permanently disables serial/login at boot 

In /boot/config.txt
	In #NOOBS Auto-generated Settings:
		enable_uart=1
	Add the end of file
		dtoverlay=pi3-miniuart-bt #Swap the serial ports
